# Prometheus exporter for Druid (http://druid.io/)

Collects HTTP POST JSON data coming from Druid daemons and expose them formatted
following the [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) standards.

## Running

The easiest way to run `druid_exporter` is via a virtualenv:

```
  LC_ALL="en_US.UTF-8" LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8" LC_ALL="en_US.UTF-8" virtualenv -p python3 .venv
  LC_ALL="en_US.UTF-8" LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8" .venv/bin/python setup.py install
  .venv/bin/druid_exporter
```

By default metrics are exposed on TCP port `8000`. Python 2 is not supported.

## Druid versions supported

This exporter is tested and used by the Wikimedia foundation with Druid version 0.9.2,
so it might not work as expected for newer versions.

## How does it work?

Druid can be configured to emit metrics (JSON data) to a HTTP endpoint configured
via the following runtime properties:

http://druid.io/docs/0.9.2/configuration/index.html#http-emitter-module

The druid prometheus exporter accepts HTTP POST data, inspects it and stores/aggregates
every supported datapoint into a data structure. It then formats the
data on the fly to Prometheus metrics when a GET /metrics is requested.

This exporter is supposed to be run on each host running a Druid daemon.

Realtime metrics have been tested only when emitted by Peons, since the Wikimedia
use case (for the moment) is to use [Tranquillity](https://github.com/druid-io/tranquility)
rather than Real Time nodes.

Please check the following document for more info:
http://druid.io/docs/0.9.2/operations/metrics.html

The JVM metrics are currently not supported, please check other projects
like https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter if you need to collect them.
